To remove folder/directory only from git repository and not from the local try 3 simple commands.

git rm -r --cached FolderName
git commit -m "Removed folder from repository"
git push origin master

Steps to ignore that folder in next commits
To ignore that folder from next commits make one file in root named .gitignore and put that folders name into it. You can put as many as you want
.gitignore file will be look like this:

/FolderName

Remove directory from git and local

git rm -r one-of-the-directories
git commit . -m "Remove duplicated directory"
git push origin <your-git-branch> (typically 'master', but not always)

Remove directory from git but NOT local

git rm -r --cached myFolder


---------------------

git config --list
git config --global user.email "{email}"
git config --global user.name "{name}"

initializes a new empty Git repository in the current directory, do this from new project folder root
> git init

add all folder contents to newly initialized Git repository
> git add .

commit to repository
> git commit -m "First commit"
